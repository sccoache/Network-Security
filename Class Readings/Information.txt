The papers in this directory are named in a schema to match the
assigned readings in CS 4404. The paper beginning with "00_" indicates
the paper is due before the first day of class, while the two papers
starting with "01_" are both due before the second class.

This directory also contains many papers which are optional and simply
present for students who are interested in learning more about a
topic. Many are associated with a topic being discussed in class
(e.g., "OPT_09_" papers are optional and are associated with the
readings for the 10th class).
